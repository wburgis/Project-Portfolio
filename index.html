					<h2>Deep Ensembles for Graphs with Higher-order Dependencies</h2>
					<a href="images/fulls/research.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/research.jpg"
							alt="" /></a>
					<p>During my year and a half of undergraduate research at Notre Dame, I have worked
						closely with Steven Krieg in researching <strong>Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)</strong>
						and the roles that higher-order dependencies play within them. I contributed to the
						creation of the
						<a href="https://github.com/sjkrieg/growhon">GrowHON</a> and 
						<a href="https://github.com/sjkrieg/growhon">HONGNN</a> models
						and determined their effectiveness on various datasets. This work resulted in our publication
						of "Deep Ensembles for Graphs with Higher-order Dependencies," which I am a Co-Author of. Click
						<a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.13988.pdf">HERE</a> to read the paper!

					<h2>Predicting U.S. County Vaccination Rates with Classifiers</h2>
					<a href="images/fulls/vaccination-paper.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/vaccination-paper.jpg"
							alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						Over the past 2+ years, the COVID-19 pandemic has consumed our lives, 
						media sources, and more. It has presented American society with a public health 
						crisis that has not been seen in generations. As a result, my team and I developed 
						this project using classifiers to classify United States county vaccination rates 
						as above or below average in an attempt to empower those fighting the COVID-19 pandemic with
						the knowledge to combat vaccine hesitancy at the county level. We employed <strong>Random Forest, 
						Neural Network, Naïve Bayes, CART, Decision Tree, SVM, and KNN</strong> classification methods with 
						5-fold cross-validation to predict the vaccination rates of these counties. Ultimately, we 
						determined Random Forest to be the most optimal classifier, and our project was voted the best 
						out of all 18 submissions. To read paper and learn more, click

					<h2>AWS Preternship Project</h2>
					<a href="images/fulls/tweet-sentiment.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img
							src="images/thumbs/tweet-sentiment.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p class="proj-desc">In this project, my team and I created a program that could act
						as a <strong>sentiment calculator</strong> in order to determine how a particular
						company is trending on Twitter. We used Tweepy to interact with the <strong>Twitter API</strong>
						and scrape Tweet content, interfaced the program with <strong>AWS Comprehend</strong>, and created
						a <strong>Python algorithm</strong> to determine the company's overall trending sentiment. Throughout the
						course of the project, we identified critical dependencies and design considerations,
						delivered weekly code reviews and professional memorandums detailing project progress,
						assessed risks and alternatives, and determined new project objectives based on those
						assessments.

					<h2>DICK'S Sporting Goods Strategic Advisory Project</h2>
					<a href="images/fulls/gs.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/gs.jpg" alt="" /></a>
					<p>
						For this project, my team and I conducted M&A, LBO, and equity analyses of Dick's Sporting Goods
						(NYSE: DKS), after which we proposed that Dick’s should acquire two private companies,
						Custom Ink ($872M) and Hudl ($415M), to <strong>expand their online presence</strong> and customization
						segment and <strong>further their involvement within the youth sports industry.</strong> In order to
						generate a comprehensive projection of Dick's future revenues, I created a C program
						to project 5 years of revenues for Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE: DKS) using <strong>linear
						regression of a series of analyst reports.</strong> We ultimately valued Dick’s at an implied
						share price of $54.76 and an enterprise value of $5.63B.

					<h2>Hulk.py</h2>
					<a href="images/fulls/hulk.jpg" class="image fit thumb"><img src="images/thumbs/hulk.jpg"

					<p>
						This project involved the use of <strong>functional programming and data processing in Python</strong>
						in order to simulate a brute-force attack on a large collection of passwords. Several
						fields can be taken as inputs from the user, including the characters in the "alphabet"
						to be used, the number of CPU cores, the length of each permutation, any prefixes to
						the permutations, and a file path that the hashes could be stored in.
